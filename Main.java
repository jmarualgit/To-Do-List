 *  Project to learn more about stacks
 *  
 *  Stacks is a data structure that follows the LIFO (last in, first out) method.
 *  If there are three tasks and the middle one is taken away then the last one will
 *  be on top of the first one; the order stays the same.
 *  
 *  Using Java swing graphics, will make a To-Do-List.
